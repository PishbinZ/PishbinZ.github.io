I’m **Zein**, a second-year Master’s student at **PSL University**, specializing in **Artificial Intelligence, Systems, and Data**.

Before joining PSL, I was a research intern at the **University of Warsaw**, where I had the privilege of working under the supervision of [Piotr Skowron](https://duch.mimuw.edu.pl/~ps219737/).

My current research focuses on **computational social choice**, particularly **proportionality in voting settings**. More broadly, I’m interested in the algorithmic aspects of collective decision-making, **fairness**, and **strategic behavior**.

For more details, please check my [CV]({{ '/cv/' | relative_url }}) or contact me by email at [zeinab.s.pishbin@gmail.com](mailto:zeinab.s.pishbin@gmail.com).

My full name is **Seyedehzeinab**, but I go by **Zein**.
